        <h1>Workshop 3</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Workshop 3, where we will dive into the core concepts of variables, data types, and 
            arithmetic operators in JavaScript. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial as they form the 
            foundation upon which you'll build more complex programs. By the end of this session, you'll 
            be comfortable declaring variables, using different data types, and performing basic arithmetic 
            operations in JavaScript.
        </p> 

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>What is a Variable?</h2>
            <p>In JavaScript, a variable is a named storage for data. Think of it as a container that holds 
                information you want to use later in your code. Variables allow you to store data values 
                that can be manipulated and retrieved as your program runs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Declaring Variables: </span> In JavaScript, you can declare a variable 
                 using three keywords: var, let, and const.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class="highlight">var: </span> The oldest way to declare a variable. It has function scope, meaning it's accessible 
                        throughout the function it was declared in, but can be problematic due to its hoisting behavior. For this reason, var is 
                        no longer used.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="highlight">let: </span> Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), let is the preferred way to declare variables 
                        because it has block scope. This means it's only accessible within the block (enclosed by {}) 
                        where it was declared.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="highlight">const: </span> Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare variables that won't 
                        be reassigned. The variable itself is constant.
                    </li>    
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples:
                <pre><code class="language-javascript">
var name = "Bob";         // Using var
let age = 25;             // Using let
const isStudent = true;   // Using const                    
                </code></pre>
                var is legacy code but it is widely used through tutorials and books and it is important to know what it is.
            </p>

            <h2>Understanding Data Types</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning the type of a variable is determined at runtime. This 
                flexibility allows you to change the type of a variable, but it also means you need to be aware of the 
                different data types and how they interact.
            </p>
        </div>
            
        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>String</h2>
            <p>Strings represent text. Strings are enclosed in quote marks (', ", or `). Strings are stored in memory 
                as a sequence of characters. The maximum size of a string variable depends on the browsers.  In Chrome and 
                Node, the limit is around 1GB (or 512MB on 32bit systems.) In Firefox, the limit is 2GB, and in Safari, the 
                limit is 4GB.  For contrast, the complete works of shakespere only takes up 5MB.
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let greeting = "Hello, World!";
let greeting = "Time flies like an arrow; Fruit flies like a banana."                  
            </code></pre>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Number</h2>
            <p>In JavaScript, the number datatype represents numeric values. This includes Integers(whole numbers) and 
               Real Numbers(Any number with a decimal point). In some text books, you will see Real numbers being split up 
               into categories of float and double and this relates to the size of memory these data types have. JavaScript 
               uses 64-bits of memory to store any number. This gives a range of +/- 9.2Quintillion (9 and 18 0s.)
               For context, That's almost the combined number of heartbeats from every human that ever lived. ever!
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let count = 42;                 
let price = 33.99;
            </code></pre>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Boolean</h2>
            <p>A boolean value only holds one bit of data, and that is either a 1 or a 0. For programming we know this
                as true or false. Booleans are mainly used for conditional statements. It can also be used as switches.
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let isActive = true;
let isStaff = false;
            </code></pre>

        </div>

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Null</h2>
            <p>The Null datatype represents 'no value' or 'nothing.' It is different to 0 as 0 is a value (an integer).
               Null is the absense of any positive, negative, and zero value. Null is empty memory.
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
let noNumber = null;
            </code></pre>

        <div class="browser-section">
            <h2>Undefined</h2>
            <p>The undefined data structure is reserved for unknown memory, or memory that has not been used 
               - it does not even contain empty memory. It is memory that has not been assigned to a value yet.
            <pre><code class="language-javascript">
